# Card Rendering Pipeline Fix - Implementation Summary

## Issues Fixed
1. **Conflicting click handlers** causing unpredictable card flipping
2. **Auto-flip behavior** triggered by style application
3. **Z-index conflicts** between front and back faces
4. **Inconsistent style application** across different effects
5. **Mixed card state management** between studio and viewer

## Changes Made

### Phase 1: Removed Click Event Interference ✅
- Removed auto-flip logic from `handleApplyCombo` in `ImmersiveCardViewer.tsx`
- Disabled double-click flip functionality in `ViewerLayout.tsx`
- Removed onClick prop from `EnhancedCardContainer.tsx`
- Disabled keyboard flip shortcut

### Phase 2: Fixed Card 3D Rendering ✅
- Simplified face visibility logic (only uses manual flip state)
- Increased Z-spacing between front (+3px) and back (-3px) faces
- Removed conflicting Z-index logic
- Standardized card edge rendering

### Phase 3: Decoupled Studio Panel from Card State ✅
- Removed card flipping from navigation handlers
- Made style application only affect visual effects, not orientation
- Cleaned up studio/card cross-dependencies

### Phase 4: Standardized Style Application ✅
- Removed auto-flip behavior from style system
- Ensured all effects apply to current visible face
- Unified style application pathway

### Phase 5: Independent System Validation ✅
- Card rotation now responds only to mouse drag
- Studio panel controls work independently
- Clean separation between rendering and interaction systems

## Result
- Card now renders consistently with proper 3D behavior
- Styles apply reliably without unexpected flipping
- Studio panel and card viewer operate independently
- Drag-to-rotate works smoothly without interference
